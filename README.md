# Thoughtstream

This is a hackathon project, intended to explore the idea of building an Executive Assistant-like agent. 

Collaborated with: @rahulchhabra07

# The Problem

We had recently lost our house keys, and were frustrated by the experience of finding it. This had to be solved. With AI, of course.

# The Solution

What if an agent could
 - understand my intent,
 - figure out the people I met yesterday from my Calendar,
 - reach out to them, chat with them,
 - figure if any of these people actually have my keys,
 - if yes, book an Uber pickup

All automagically?

# Tools

Open-Interpreter python has been used to show the proof-of-concept here. Check out `tools.py` for the same.

# The Demo'd hack

Because of time limitations on the hackathon, we were able to demonstrate only the following
- A working prototype of a voice-to-voice conversation with Open-Interpreter using this forked repo: https://github.com/KillianLucas/01-rewrite/tree/main
- A working prototype of two agents working with each other to find my keys. The two agents are the "Executive Assistant" and the "Communications Manager Agent"

# What we'd have liked to do

We wanted to setup another tool that could orchestrate an Uber Pickup from my friend's place to bring over the keys to me!

This is a very simplistic implementation, and we'd like to extend on this to build a full-fledged AI assistant. If you're interested, hit me up!

PS: We won third prize at the hackathon :))
